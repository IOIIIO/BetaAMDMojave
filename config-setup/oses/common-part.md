Download CorpNewt's AMDVanillaPatches here. This tool will be used to add the clover patches needed to patch the kernel for AMD usage. My screenshots will show Windows, but the same should apply to macOS.

Extract and open the .zip. On Windows double click on _AMDVanillaPatches.bat_ on macOS on _AMDVanillaPatches.command_. You should be greeted by the following screen.

On this screen now type in `2` and press enter. Windows: Navigate to wherever your config is stored, {**Windows:** if you copied it to your USB drive it should be in \[your drive\]/EFI/CLOVER} {**macOS:** The file should be in EFI/Clover} Drag the file in to the window of the tool and press enter.
