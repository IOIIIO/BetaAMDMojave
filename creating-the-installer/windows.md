Now **MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE PROPER DRIVE** as we will be erasing it. Type in the number of your drive and then press enter. In my case I need `3`. Now you need to give the tool some time again as it sets up the USB drive and installs Clover to it. The following screen will show when it's done:

Browse to `GibMacOS` &gt; `macOS Downloads` &gt; `publicrelease` &gt; _`[macOS version]`._ Hold down shift and right click on the file. Press `Copy as Path`. Right click again in the cmd window to paste the path. Now press enter and it will start extracting.
